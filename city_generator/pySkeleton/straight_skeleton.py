    """
    A straight skeleton is a graph that represent the straight skeleton of
    a polygon. The polygon can be made of several connected components.
    
    The straight skeleton algorithm, first developped by O. Aichholzer,
    F. Aurenhammer, D. Alberts and B. Gartner in 1995 processes by shrinking
    the edges of the polygon perpendiculary to their direction. The algorithm is driven
    by a sequence of degenerated events that can happen while shrinking the polygon such as :
        - edge event : an edge collapse to a single point
        - split event : a (reflex) vertex split an edge into two
        - vertex event : some split event occur at the same time at the same place
    Each event will change the topology of the polygon
    
    The current implementation of the straight skeleton does not follow the optimization tricks
    developped in the literature, such as the priority queue. Nonetheless, such improvements will be
    taken into account in the next versions.
    
    Know bugs :
    The current implementation does not support simultaneous split events.
